# AI-ML-train-test-split-evaluation-metrics-task-5
This project involved building a binary classification model using Logistic Regression. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, the model was trained on training data, and predictions were made on test data. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to assess model reliability.
